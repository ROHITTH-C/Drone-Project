Project Title: Real-Time Location Detection of Individuals in Natural Disasters Using Drones

Description: This project focuses on developing a sophisticated system for real-time tracking and location detection of individuals during natural disasters using drone technology. Leveraging Python, the system integrates advanced algorithms to process and analyze aerial imagery captured by drones.

The project aims to enhance disaster response efforts by providing accurate location data, which is critical for rescuing individuals in emergency situations. Key features include:

Real-Time Tracking: The system continuously monitors the drone's flight path and utilizes GPS data to pinpoint the location of individuals in distress.
Automated Image Processing: Python libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow are employed for image analysis, enabling the detection of people amidst various terrains and obstacles.
User-Friendly Interface: The data is presented through an intuitive interface, allowing rescue teams to quickly interpret the information and take necessary action.
